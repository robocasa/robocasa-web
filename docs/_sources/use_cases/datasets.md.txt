# Datasets

RoboCasa comes with a large selection of demonstrations to faciliate training agents. This includes human trajectories and machine-generated trajectories from [MimicGen](https://mimicgen.github.io/). 


## Dataset Types

Generally we have 3 different dataset types for a specific task:

- **human_raw**: human collected dataset of 50 demos/task that contains raw mujoco states as opposed to image observations.
- **human_im**: contains same data as human_raw but has camera observations stored; these correspond to the **Human-50** dataset used in the atomic tasks experiments and the downstream training dataset for the composite tasks experiments.
- **mg_im**: contains 3000/task of mimicgen-generated trajectories corresponding to the **Generated-3000** dataset in the atomic tasks experiments. 

At the moment all atomic tasks and the ArrangeVegetables, MicrowaveThawing, RestockPantry, PreSoakPan, and PrepareCoffee composite tasks have both human_raw and human_im datasets

All atomic tasks except KitchenNavigate also have mg_im datasets.

## Downloading Datasets

Here are a few ways to download the datasets:
```
# downloads all datasets
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_datasets

# downloads datasets for specific tasks
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_datasets --tasks PnPCounterToCab ArrangeVegetables

# overwrites existing datasets
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_datasets --overwrite

# lite download: download only human datasets without images
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_datasets --ds_types human_raw

# download only mimicgen datasets
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_datasets --ds_types mg_im
```

By default, all datasets are stored under `datasets/` in the root robocasa directory.
